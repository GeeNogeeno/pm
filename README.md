### Agenda Items
Agenda's are posted to https://github.com/goerli/testnet/issues, with the `[Comms]` prefix distinguishing the specific issue related to the contributors calls. Anyone is welcome to add an item to the agenda as long as it follows these guidelines:
- The topic is technical in nature.
- The topic involves the Görli testnet.
- The topic should not be philosophical. The Görli contributors meetings are not meant to decide philosophical contentious issues that should be decided by the community. There are exceptions to this, but generally these topics distract from more productive technical discussion.

### Who Manages the Meetings
The Görli community manages these meetings through our [gitter](https://gitter.im/goerli/testnet).
